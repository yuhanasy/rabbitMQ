# I am Learning RabbitMQ

In this project, I am following official RabbitMQ [tutorials](https://www.rabbitmq.com/getstarted.html) to understand how rabbitMQ works.

Instead of installing rabbitMQ locally on my machine, I use cloud rabbitMQ with [cloudamqp](https://customer.cloudamqp.com/instance/). We can signup for free account and free plan, and then create an instances. THe process is easy.

From my rabbitMQ instances console, I copy the amqp url. This url is like my rabbitMQ server url. From the tutorial, replace the `amqp://localhost` with that url. We can open rabbitMQ manager by clicking the button on the right of our instance.

To get a better understanding, I keep switching between my terminal and rabbitMQ manager, and watching what happened under the hood.
